Have you ever wondered what Better With Mods would be like if it was <del>slightly more</del> functional on 1.7.10? You may not have to wonder much longer.
<br>Better With Patches is a collection of various tweaks, improvements and workarounds for the last known Beta versions of Better With Mods.
</p>
<br>Here's a complete list of features:
<br>-A mix of small fixes and tweaks to various parts of the mod for the sake of preventing crashes, correcting implementation and potentially improving performance;
<br>-Improvements (and outright replacement in cases) for the recipe internals, such as removing hardcoded behaviours and adding more ways to define recipes;
<br>-<a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/betterwithpatches/screenshots" rel="nofollow">Recipe views for NotEnoughItems</a>, made to resemble Better With Mods' own displays from 1.9+;
<br>-<a href="https://github.com/Yoghurt4C/BetterWithPatches/wiki/MineTweaker-Support" rel="nofollow">MineTweaker integration</a>&nbsp;for most of the mod's features, largely resembling Better With Mods' own compat with slight differences;
<br>-<a href="https://github.com/Yoghurt4C/BetterWithPatches/wiki/Hardcore-Features">Backported Hardcore Features</a>&nbsp;from the more recent versions of Better With Mods;
<p>
<br>As of version <strong>0.6.8</strong>, the appropriate&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.org/details/better-with-mods-1.7.10-0.6.2-beta">version of Better With Mods</a> will be automatically downloaded on startup and does not need to be downloaded manually (unless you're having connectivity issues).&nbsp;>
<br>This mod REQUIRES either&nbsp;<a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/unimixins">Unimixins</a>&nbsp;(Minimal modular install should be Unimix + GTNH Mixins module + SpongeMixins module) or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/gtnhmixins">GTNH Mixins</a>!&nbsp;
<br>For a more detailed list of changes, see the source code. Most of the patches are accompanied by JavaDoc comments, which provide (brief) reasonings for whichever changes may have been made.
